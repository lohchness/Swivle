# Swivle!

![](/assets/swivle2.png)

A game about pivoting letters to make words.

# How to play

Select two letters to pivot, three or more to submit (spacebar for both actions). You have a limited amount of moves and submitting a word returns moves - 3 letters: 1 move 4-5 letters: 2 moves, 6 letters: 3 moves.

Here's a demo (the first version, without any scoring/moves/theme overhauls implemented):
