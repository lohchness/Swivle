A game about pivoting letters to make words. [Blogpost!](https://lohchness.github.io/posts/swivle/)

# How to play

Select two letters to pivot, three or more to submit (spacebar for both actions). You have a limited amount of time and submitting a word extends your time - the longer the word, the more time is extended.
